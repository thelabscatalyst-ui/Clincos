# The suite registers a doctor ~116 times, and POST /register queues a real

# synchronously as part of the response. config.py loads .env for tests too,
# so a live RESEND_API_KEY meant ~116 real sends per run against a 100/day
# quota.
#
# Zeroing the key makes services.email_service.send_email short-circuit
# before any network I/O and return ("not configured"). Deliberately NOT
# monkeypatching send_email itself: TestEmailService/TestInviteService call
# it directly and assert on that exact return value.
#
# This import must stay BELOW the DATABASE_URL line above — config builds its
# Settings singleton at import time, so importing it any earlier would bind
# the suite to the real dev database.

# ── Razorpay: hard-off for the entire suite ─────────────────────────────────
# Same failure mode as the email key above, and it bit for the same reason:
# config.py loads .env for tests too, and .env holds LIVE keys (rzp_live_…).
# test_create_order_without_credentials_does_not_500 posts to
# /billing/create-order, so every full suite run was creating a real order on
# the production Razorpay account. Orders are only payment intents — no money
# moves and nothing is charged — but they accumulate as junk in the dashboard
# and the suite has no business touching a live payment gateway at all.
#
# Blanking the keys makes _razorpay_client() return None, so create_order
# short-circuits to "Payment gateway not configured" before any network call.
# That is also exactly the branch the test means to assert.

# ── Cloudflare R2: hard-off for the entire suite ────────────────────────────
# Third instance of the same failure mode. Once .env holds real R2 keys, an
# unblanked suite would write every uploaded test fixture into the production
# document vault and — worse — the delete and delete_prefix tests would run
# against real patient files.
#
# Blanking these makes services.storage_service.is_configured() False, so the
# whole suite uses the local-disk fallback under uploads/. That is also the
# branch most tests should be exercising anyway: they assert on authorisation
# and wiring, not on Cloudflare's behaviour.
